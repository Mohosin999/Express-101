# Express 101

## Create An Express Project

Go to your terminal and run the following command.

```
npm init -y

```

After that, create an "index.js" file in root directory. Go to the "package.json" file and update "script" section like following:

```
"scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js"
  },
```

Now if go to terminal and run "npm start" then the project will run. ("npm run " will be for "dev" and others command.). Finally project setup completed.
